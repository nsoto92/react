# Build a simple React app that has a <FriendList /> component, a <Friend /> component and a <Pet /> component.

# In <FriendList />, .map() through an array of friends. Each friend will have an array of pets. Feel free to use array at the bottom of this write up. In your .map(), render a <Friend /> component, passing through the name, age, and pets of each friend as props.

# <Friend /> Should display the info nicely. Use some styles and appropriate HTML(JSX) tags. <Friend /> Should also .map() through the pets array and render <Pet />. Pets should also be displayed nicely.

Think about how you display strings, numbers, and arrays while building this app.
