## You Must
1. Create a class component called **DiceBox** 
2. Write a method in that class that produces 5 random numbers between 1 and 6 and saves them in state.
3. Display the 5 random numbers in your **DiceBox** JSX.
4. Provide a button the user can click on that will redo step 2 and present the new numbers to the user.

## Take it further (optional extra credit)
1. Create a **Die** component that receives a random number as a prop and displays it (rather than just displaying the 5 numbers in the **DiceBox** JSX).
1. Allow the user to click on a given **Die** to select it, and that number will not change until the dice reset (resetting is done in the next step).
1. Have the dice reset (de-selecting all previously selected die and setting their numbers back to 0) after every 3rd roll.
